# Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of eight different algorithms in various programming languages. Each algorithm has its own branch, and you can find the details and code for each algorithm in its respective branch.

## Algorithms

1. **Large Integers Multiplying**: This algorithm is used for multiplying large integers.

   - Branch: [large-integers-multiplying](https://github.com/MahdiAsadolahzade/Algorithm_Design_Codes/tree/large-Integers-Multiplying)

2. **Merge Sort**: A sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer strategy.

   - Branch: [merge-sort](https://github.com/MahdiAsadolahzade/Algorithm_Design_Codes/tree/Merge-Sort)

3. **Optimal Binary Search Tree**: This algorithm finds the optimal binary search tree given a set of keys and their probabilities.

   - Branch: [optimal-bst](https://github.com/MahdiAsadolahzade/Algorithm_Design_Codes/tree/Optimal-BST)

4. **Fractional Knapsack**: Solves the fractional knapsack problem to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack.

   - Branch: [fractional-knapsack](https://github.com/MahdiAsadolahzade/Algorithm_Design_Codes/tree/Knapsack-Fractional)

5. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
